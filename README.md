  ## Description

  I started this project from scratch, there were no starter files or snippets of code to use.
  I initally started with the html file, making sure that I linked jquery, bootstrap, and my javascript file to it. I then started to make the general shape of the website using rows and columns. I then started to make all of the necessary ids that my javascript would need to add dynamic buttons and information.
  Once done, I went into the javascript and got the api key so that I would be able to get the information over. I started with a event listener next for clicking on the search button so that when they searched a city it would know to take that value. Then run that value to the api to query for information regarding it, which, I would then pick through and pull the pertanant information over to my weather dashboard and attach to the predesignated tags with ids in my html document. 
  Once I had the current day forcast listed, I shifted to the five day forcast which involved using a different query to obtain information over a longer time period. I did the same with the second set of information and sifted through it to obtain the information I needed and then attach it to the correct places in my html.
  Next was to start on my search history, I created a function to look through and array of values that were pushed into the array once the user searched a city. This allowed me to list buttons to the side that the user can click on to look again at their previous searches.
